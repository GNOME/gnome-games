Games is a GNOME 3 application to browse your video games library and to
easily pick and play a game from it. It aims to do for games what Music
already does for your music library.

You want to install Games if you just want a very simple and comfortable
way to play your games and you donâ€™t need advanced features such as
speedrunning tools or video game development tools.

## Developing
We support development using Flatpak via GNOME Builder. At the Builder
"Clone..." dialog, enter https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-games.git, and the
default build + run development flow using Flatpak should work.
